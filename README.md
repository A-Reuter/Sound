# About The Project

## The Tool
A tool for simulating firing sequences within workflow nets to check conformance to the soundness property.

## Primary Goal
The main goal of this project is the creation of a web-based application that supports students in learning about the structure and properties of workflow nets.

## Main Features

* loading a petri net from a .pnml or .json file
* checking whether a given petri net is a workflow net
* visualizing a workflow net within an interactive canvas
* firing of individual transitions enabled by the current marking
* checking whether a reached marking conforms to the soundness property
* visualizing aspects of a reached marking that do not conform to the soundness property
* recording all previously completed firing sequences within a log
* replaying firing sequences from the log
* automated firing sequences

## Built With

* Angular
* Node.js

* TypeScript
* HTML
* CSS

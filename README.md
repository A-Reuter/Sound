# About The Project

## The Tool
Sound is a tool for simulating firing sequences within workflow nets to check conformance to the soundness property.

## Primary Goal
The main goal of this project is the creation of a web-based application that supports students in learning about the structure and properties of workflow nets.

## Main Features

* interactive net visualization
* testing workflow net requirements
* manual firing of individual transitions
* automated execution of random firing sequences
* replaying entries from a log of completed firing sequences
* checking the conformance of a marking to the soundness property

## Built With

* Angular
* Node.js

* TypeScript
* HTML
* CSS

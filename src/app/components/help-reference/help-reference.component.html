        <p style="margin-bottom:5px;">note: this guide is based on the default settings</p>
        <p class="list-t0-i10">(<em>should any settings have been changed to a degree impacting the applicability of this guide, the default settings can be restored by reloading the web page</em>)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Start by loading a petri net from a file via the file menu or by dragging it onto the canvas.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a petri net has been successfully loaded, the tool automatically tests if it is a workflow net.
                Should this not be the case, an error will be thrown and a new button will appear in the top right corner of the canvas, 
                which can be used to open the error information panel listing more details about the unfulfilled condition(s).
                If, however, the net passes the workflow check, you can then fire any enabled transition by clicking on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transitions enabled by the current net marking are highlighted when using the default display mode setting. <br/>
                The display mode can be toggled using the selector switch to the right above the canvas, while a legend listing 
                the different highlight colors for every mode can be accessed using the info button next to that switch.
            </li>
            <li>
                After each firing action, the net marking is changed accordingly, and the tool determines whether the reached marking 
                is in conflict with the first two criteria of the soundness property (pertaining to termination and its correctness).
                When such a conflict is detected, an error will be thrown and once again details will be made accessible through the error information panel. <br/>
                Conformance to the third criterion (pertaining to transition liveness) is checked whenever a sequence terminates.
                Should a given net contain at least one dead transition, an error state pertaining to all dead transitions 
                will be triggered on sequence termination once every live transition has been fired at least once.
                Progress on verifying conformance to this criterion can be checked manually by switching 
                to the traveled display mode and looking for unvisited transitions.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the active sequence has not terminated and no error has occurred, another transition may be fired to expand the sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
                At any point during the execution of a sequence, you can undo or redo individual firing actions, or reset the net 
                to the initial marking by using the corresponding buttons or edit menu entries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whenever a firing sequence terminates, either with or without an error, the tool checks whether this sequence is already 
                present within the sequence log, and, if it is not, appends it to the log, which can be found below the canvas.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a sequence has terminated, resetting the net will allow for the execution of a new sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
                At any time, a sequence from the log can be loaded by selecting it from the log panel, which can then be retraced by using 
                the undo and redo buttons or the respective entries of the edit menu to skip to skip backward or forward.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, the current progress - including net, current marking, active sequence, sequence log & found errors - 
                can be saved to a .sav file anytime to be restored later.
            </li>
        </ul>
